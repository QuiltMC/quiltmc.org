Quilt is a mod-loader project - primarily aimed at Minecraft. It was founded by users and contributors from the Fabric 
project, as a last-resort attempt to address the controversies and issues stemming from that project. Because Fabric 
had a solid technological foundation with code that still did many things right, Quilt's founders decided that the 
best option would be to take the standard open source approach to disagreements over management - they forked the 
Fabric project into a new mod-loader project, with the following ideas in mind:

* Allowing contributors to move fast and break things when appropriate, and allowing for experimental work
* Building transparency into official community spaces and policies
* Creating a community team that understands the importance of Quilt's values, and that fosters inclusivity, diversity

* Providing a governance structure that doesn't give anyone too much power, and avoids creating opportunities for 
  staff members to operate without oversight
* Providing ways to keep the community involved with important project decisions

Quilt has grown quickly since its inception,
