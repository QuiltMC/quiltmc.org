                The Quilt Initiative Discord server is created, as a temporary place to put together an initial
                plan for the Quilt project.

                The Quilt Community Discord server is founded, to provide an official, public community space. While
                things are still being set up and planned out, single-use invites are handed out to trusted, prominent
                Fabric community members - the server isn't made public immediately.

                The Quilt Community Discord server is officially made public, with proper invites being created
                and handed out. Almost 350 users join the server on this first day, which is emblematic of people's
                interest in the project and its community.

                On the same day, the Quilt Toolchain Discord server is set up and opened to the public. This server was
                designed for project-relevant development discussions, as a place for people to work together on Quilt
                and its projects, and for everyone else to gain a window into Quilt's development processes.
