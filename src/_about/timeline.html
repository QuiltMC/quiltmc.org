                The Quilt Initiative Discord server is created, as a temporary place to put together an initial
                plan for the Quilt project.

                The Quilt Community Discord server is founded, to provide an official, public community space. While
                things are still being set up and planned out, single-use invites are handed out to trusted, prominent
                Fabric community members &ndash; the server isn't made public immediately.

                To drum up some interest and figure out what the modding community would think about Quilt, one of the
                founding members posts a <a href="https://pastebin.com/spNgyCMD">Pastebin "leak"</a> on a drama
                server. The document includes some information about the governance and moderation policy of a new
                project named "Fabrique", a false name used to avoid exposing Quilt's projects before they were ready
                to be made public.

                The Quilt GitHub organisation runs out of free Actions minutes, which means that its repositories
                must be made public. It doesn't take long for people to find them, either!

                The Quilt Community Discord server is officially made public, with proper invites being created
                and handed out. Almost 350 users join the server on this first day, which is emblematic of people's
                interest in the project and its community.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the same day, the Quilt Toolchain Discord server is set up and opened to the public. This server was
                designed for project-relevant development discussions, as a place for people to work together on Quilt
                and its projects, and for everyone else to gain a window into Quilt's development processes.

                On the Community server, a game of <a href="https://skribbl.io">skribbl.io</a> was played to celebrate
                the server's opening to the public. During this game, a player was tasked with drawing a pumpkin, and
                many of the players guessed "pineapple". This drawing quickly became a community favourite, and
                Pineapple was born &ndash; Quilt's first community mascot.

                Quilt officially entered its first beta today, attracting an influx of new users and an amazing amount
                of support and positive feedback. By the end of the day, Quilt was happily loading both Quilt and
                Fabric mods, and had <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl">uploaded QSL to Modrinth</a>.
