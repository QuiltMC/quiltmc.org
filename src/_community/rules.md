title: Rules
---

We expect everyone that makes use of any Quilt community spaces to adhere to the following rules. If you have any
questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact a member of the community team or ask your question in the
`#discord-meta` channel.

**Remember:** Ignorance of our rules is not an excuse for breaking them. You are responsible for educating yourself on
how every community you join expects you to behave, and "I didn't know that was in the rules" will never be a valid
excuse.

#### 1) Follow our Code of Conduct

Make sure you read and follow [our Code of Conduct]({% link _community/code-of-conduct.md %}), which outlines what we 
expect from you and is the basis for these rules. It's important that you read and understand the Code of
Conduct, and the rules on this page - feel free to contact a community team member if you need any clarification.

That said, remember that there will sometimes be situations that are difficult to fit into the Code of Conduct at a
glance. In these cases, please contact a member of the community team for clarification.

#### 2) Follow Discord's Rules

In all community spaces, everyone must also follow the Discord [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) 
and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

These aren't just good to follow as a general rule of thumb - this is also a requirement when operating a large 
community on Discord, especially if that community is aiming to be partnered or verified.

#### 3) Try to speak English

The world is a big place, and many people will have a different native language. The common language in our community is
English, but we understand that not everyone speaks English at the same level.

If you're not a native English speaker, please try to speak English to the best of your ability. Don't worry if you need
to use a translation tool, or if your English isn't great - we won't make fun of you, and we'll help you figure out the
right words if you get stuck.

#### 4) Listen to & respect all community team members

The community team is here to support the community, keep it running smoothly, and ensure that it remains safe and 
friendly. In order to allow us to do our jobs, we need you to cooperate with us.

Essentially, please take requests from community team members seriously and listen when a team member asks you to do 
something. If you have a problem with what a team member is asking you to do, we advise that you step away from the 
situation and send a private message to another team member.

#### 5) Keep all projects legal & appropriate

If you need help with a project, you will not be provided with it if your project may break laws, breach a Terms of
Service or EULA (belonging to any organisation, not just the platforms we're using), or be considered malicious or 
inappropriate.

Additionally, keep your code appropriate. Do not sexualize your code or use any slurs or other forms of derogatory
language, either in the code itself or in the assets or filenames that make up your project.

#### 6) Don't spam, or advertise outside the showcase channels

We provide a number of channels for showcasing and informing users about your Quilt-related projects. Outside of these
channels, we will not tolerate advertising or any other form of spam. In particular, posting large numbers of images or
lines of text together can be particularly disruptive, and we'd prefer you make use of a pastebin site or image
uploading site when sharing a lot of text or images.

We may remove links to other Discord servers, communities and projects at our discretion if we feel like they've been
posted inappropriately, rather than to start or contribute to a discussion.

#### 7) Follow the given channel topic, and don't derail a discussion

Most of our channels are strictly on-topic, and we expect our users to take note of a channel's topic and stick to it.
We understand that conversations may span multiple topics and move onto something else, but we may ask you to move if
a conversation leaves the scope of a channel's topic.

Additionally, when entering a channel with an active discussion, please be mindful of that discussion and do not try to
derail it (by talking over it, for example). We have multiple general (off-topic) channels you can use if a channel is
busy.

#### 8) Keep non-free mappings out of the community spaces

Do not mention names from MCP, Mojang or other proprietary mappings in our community spaces. While we understand that
this may be less than ideal for some users and projects, this rule is necessary to protect all non-proprietary 
mappings projects (and their contributors).

You're welcome to link to websites and projects that make use of proprietary mappings, but you must always tag your
message to point out that proprietary names are present, and spoiler your link by surrounding it with double pipes - 
for example, `[MCP] ||link||`.

{% comment %}
NOTE: If we decide to go this route, this rule needs to be updated to something like the following.

Do not mention names from MCP, Mojang or other proprietary mappings outside the `#mod-dev-proprietary` channel. If 
you wish to talk about proprietary mappings (or working with them), you can gain access to this channel by using 
the `!proprietary-mappings` command in the `#bot-commands` channel.
{% endcomment %}

#### 9) Don't import drama or controversy from other communities

We aim to be a safe place for everyone - regardless of their background, identity, or other defining trait. In order 
to do this, it's important that people are allowed to interact without having to worry about controversies from the
wider modding community that they may be seeking refuge from.

Additionally, we expect a certain level of professionalism from our members. For both of these reasons, discussion
of drama or controversies from other communities is banned - including the numerous controversies that have unfolded 
within other spaces in the wider modding community.

If you'd like to discuss these controversies with other users, start a DM group or join a community that's designed to 
handle that discussion.

### Non-message mediums

Do not change your avatar, nickname, username or custom/rich status to try to protest a moderation action, or to attack
or harass any user.

#### Nicknames

All nicknames must adhere to the rules above. Additionally, they should not be hard to read or too noisy. Nicknames
may be considered difficult to read or noisy if they contain emojis, Zalgo or other difficult-to-read styling, or
Unicode control characters. "Empty" nicknames are also considered difficult to read.

We also reserve the right to change or reset nicknames that are designed to place you higher in the member list in
community spaces that have one, which is known as "hoisting".

#### Avatars

All avatars must adhere to the rules above. Additionally, avatars depicting objectionable or Not Safe For Work (NSFW)
content are disallowed, as well as fully-transparent avatars or avatars that appear to be fully-transparent by 
matching the platform's background colour.

#### Custom/Rich Statuses

All user statuses must adhere to the rules above. In particular, we don't want to see objectionable or NSFW
emoji, the advertising of sketchy or NSFW websites, or hateful sentiment.

### Reporting

To report rule-breaking behaviour on Discord, mention the **@Moderators** role directly in the channel, and a community 
team member will be along as soon as they can be. Alternatively, you can send a private message directly to any 
community team member, or otherwise contact the community team using the relevant contact methods for the given 
community space.

If your report concerns a community team member, please send a private message directly to a different 
member of the community team or a member of the administrative board. All private reports will be treated with 
confidentiality.

### Enforcement

Our community team members have multiple tools at their disposal when dealing with those who violate the rules, 
including the following:

* Verbally/textually warning or correcting users
* Forcibly changing a user's nickname
* Temporarily muting users
* Temporarily or permanently removing users from the community (kicking, tempbanning, banning)

Each situation is unique, and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. All actions taken in response to rule-breaking
behaviour is done at the discretion of the community team member in question - however, we will take feedback from 
the community if its members are not happy with how things were resolved.

We do not currently have a way to appeal community bans. While we're figuring that out, feel free to add any community 
manager and send your appeal in a private message.

#### Moderation Guidelines

Moderation is a complicated subject at best, and it requires a lot of nuance and difficult decision-making. While
it's impossible to enumerate every possible situation (and some situations will not suit our documentation), we've done
our best to explain how we come to a decision, and what we expect from our community team.

For more information on this, feel free to read
[our moderation guidelines]({% link _community/moderation.md %}). If you have any feedback on this document, feel free to 
contact us!
