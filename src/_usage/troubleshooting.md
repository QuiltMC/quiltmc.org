# General Issues
{% admonition %}
## My game is crashing. Why is this happening?
Your game is most likely crashing because something's gone wrong in a mod you have installed. The best way
to check why your game is crashing is to look at the logs/latest.log file in your .minecraft directory.
This file usually has the info as to why your game is crashing, but if you can't find the error,
it's going to be more difficult. First, check all the mods you have are for the Minecraft version you are running.
If any of them are not, remove those mods and try again. If you still have the same issue, check the latest.log
file again, and see if there's a legible error this time round. If there's still not, go onto the
[Quilt Community Discord](https://discord.quiltmc.org/community) in the #quilt-support channel, and post your logs and any other relevant info
and see if any of the friendly team there can help you work out your crash. Do note, though, to
avoid pinging someone without reason and do read the rules in #welcome before posting.
