  <div slot="caring">
    Quilt is community-driven, and couldn't exist without its users and
    contributors. We care about our community; whether you're a member of our
    community spaces, an occasional contributor to one of our projects or
    simply a user: **Quilt exists for your needs** -- not in spite of them.
  </div>
  <div slot="modular">
    Quilt's modularity doesn't just exist to help with organising its code --
    **it extends to its users and modders too**. If you're a modder, our build
    tools will keep track of the Quilt libraries your mod uses. If you're a
    user, Quilt can automatically download the Quilt libraries needed to run
    your mods.
  </div>
  <div slot="powerful">
    Quilt has the extra features and tools your mods need to succeed. From a
    rich library of modules that help you to write more compatible mods with
    less effort, to one of the most accurate decompilers provided by any
    Minecraft modding toolchain, you can be sure that **your mod is in good
    hands**.
