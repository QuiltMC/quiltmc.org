Quilt is a community-driven project, and there are lots of ways you can help make it better.

## Contributing Code
Quilt is primarily a software project, and there's lots of things you can help with if you can code. Most of our projects are written in Java, such as [Quilt Loader](https://github.com/quiltmc/quilt-loader) and [Enigma](https://github.com/quiltmc.org/enigma), but several are written in other languages, such as [our website](https://github.com/quiltmc/quiltmc.org) (written in [Astro](https://astro.build) and TypeScript) or the [Cozy bot](https://github.com/quiltmc/cozy) (written in Kotlin). You can find [a list of all our software](https://github.com/orgs/QuiltMC/repositories) on GitHub.

Once you find a project that you're interested in helping with, you can visit its Issues page to see what needs doing, or join our [Discord server](https://discord.quiltmc.org) to ask the developers directly. If you find an issue you'd like to try and address, you should join the server and discuss your plans with the developers before starting, unless the fix is particularly simple.

All of our projects are source-controlled using [Git](https://git-scm.com) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/quiltmc). To make a contribution, you should [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the repository you want to contribute to to create your own copy, make your changes, then create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to have them added to the main repository. Some projects have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with specific instructions for that project, and many others have instructions for contributing in their README.md files. If you need any help with contributing, please [join our Discord server](https://discord.quiltmc.org) to talk with the developers.

## Contributing Something Else
If you can't code, one of the best ways to help is to [join our Discord server](https://discord.quiltmc.org) and help others with using Quilt, or just hang out and help make it a great place to be.

## Financial Contributions
Quilt has [a donations page on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/quiltmc), which pays for infrastructure like our domain name and our Maven and Meta services. Thanks to our community's generosity, we are currently receiving enough funding to keep them running for a long time yet.
