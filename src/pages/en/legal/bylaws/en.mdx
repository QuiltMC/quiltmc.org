# Foreword

This contains the bylaws of The Quilt Project, a non-profit organization registered in France.

This is an unofficial, non legally binding translation of the bylaws of the [official bylaws](/en/legal/bylaws/fr/).
In case of a conflict between the two, the official French bylaws take precedence.

# Bylaws

## Article 1

On May 21, 2023, an association governed by the law of July 1, 1901 and the decree of August 16, 1901, entitled “The Quilt Project” was founded between members of these bylaws and those who will subsequently join.

The association is also designated by the name “Quilt”.


## Article 2
This association aims to create an inclusive community around the QuiltMC mod-loader project, as well as to support this project.

## Article 3
The office is in the domiciliation company, whose identification number is 880 522 487.

The office address is :
154 Rue de Rome
Bureau 3
13006 Marseille
France

## Article 4
The duration of the association is unlimited.

## Article 5
Membership of the association is free without annual fees, subject to acceptance by the office.

## Article 6
Active members are those who join the association.

## Article 7
Membership is lost by:
- Resignation.
- Death.
- Expulsion pronounced by the board of directors for any reason.

## Article 8
The ordinary general assembly includes all the members of the association in whatever capacity.

It gathers at least once per year.

Fifteen days at least before the fixed date, the members of the association are convened. The agenda appears on the convocations.

Only the members of the office have the right to vote, regardless of their age.

All deliberations are taken by electronic vote, by a majority of the votes cast.

The decisions of general meetings are binding on all members, including those absent or represented.

## Article 9
If necessary, the board of directors may convene an extraordinary general assembly, in accordance with the procedures provided for in these articles of association and only for modification of the articles of association or dissolution.

## Article 10
The board of directors is composed of members part of the “Legal Team” within the organization “QuiltMC”.

The treasurers are members, part of the “Administrative Board” within the organization “QuiltMC”.

They together form the office.

## Article 11
All functions, including those of the members of the board of directors and the office, are free and voluntary.

Only the costs incurred by the fulfilment of their mandate are reimbursed on receipts.

## Article 12

A set of internal regulations can be drawn up by the board of directors, which then has them approved by the general meeting.

This possible regulation is intended to fix the various points not envisaged by the present statutes, in particular those which relate to the internal administration of the association.

## Article 13

In the event of dissolution pronounced according to the procedures provided for in Article 11, one or more liquidators are appointed, and the net assets, if any, are devolved to a non-profit organization in accordance with the decisions of the extraordinary general meeting which rules on the dissolution.

The net assets cannot be devolved to a member of the association, even partially, except for the recovery of a contribution.

Not prohibiting the allocation of net assets to a member could compromise the criterion of disinterested management, tax application of Article 1 of the law of 1901, and therefore the qualification of general interest.

## Article 14

These statutes were approved during the constitutive general assembly on May 21, 2023.

They have been drawn up in as many copies as there are interested parties, including one for the declaration, one for the Prefecture and one for the association.
