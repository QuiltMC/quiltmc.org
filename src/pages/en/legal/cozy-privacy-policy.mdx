## Foreword

This policy was created as required by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You can find more about the GDPR on [GDPR.eu](https://gdpr.eu/).

This document details the data collected by Quilt through the Cozy Discord bot, how it is used and how to exercise your rights related to your data.

Quilt ("Quilt", "Us", "We", "Our") is the data controller for the data collected through the Cozy Discord bot.

## Data Collected

### Discord Messages

When you send a message in one of our servers, we record its content and location on the server, as well as the author's User ID, for a limited period of time. We use this data to moderate users who send rule-breaking messages and edit or delete them before are seen by a moderator. The data is erased after five days.

### Filter Events

When you trigger an automatic filter, we record your User ID and the location on the server of the message that triggered it. The message content isn't saved.

We use this data to allow moderators to review and action messages that are triggered by automatic filters.

### Threads

If you are designated as the owner of a thread by creating it, or having the current owner transfer it to you,
your User ID is saved alongside the thread ID.

We use this data to allow you to manage the threads that you own.

### User Flags

We save two flags about you:
- Auto Publish: whether messages that you send in an Announcement channel should be automatically published to servers following that channel.
- Sync Nicknames: whether your nickname should be synced between Quilt guilds. Your nickname is not saved.

## Data Retention

Unless stated otherwise above, data is retained indefinitely. We do not delete any data unless you request it.

# Data Governance

Database access is limited to the minimum of Quilt staff required to operate the service. We do not share any data with third parties. We do not sell any data.

Data is stored in the EU with the following processors:
- [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com)
- [Contabo](https://contabo.com/en/)

BackBlaze is compliant with the DoC's [Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

Data is encrypted in transit.
