# Foreword

The following document was created as required by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR).
You can find more information about that regulation on [gdpr.eu](https://gdpr.eu/).

This document details what and why data is collected by QuiltMC through the Cozy Discord bots, except "Cozy (Stats)",
how it is used and how to use your rights related to your data.

QuiltMC ("Us", "We", "Our") is the data controller for the data collected through the Cozy Discord bots.

# Data Collected

## Filter Events

When you trigger an automatic filter, we record your User ID and the location of the message that triggered it.
The message content isn't saved.

We use this data to conduct analytics.

## Threads

If you are designated as the owner of a thread by creating it, or having the current owner transfer it to you,
your User ID is saved alongside the thread ID.

We use this data to allow you to manage the threads you own.

## Suggestions

### Voting

When you vote positively or negatively, we save your User ID alongside the suggestion and your vote.

We use this data to make sure you can't vote more than once.

### Creating a suggestion

When you create a suggestion, we save your User ID, Username, Avatar Url, Message and whether it was proxied or not.

We use this data to display and keep track of the suggestions. This data can be seen on the public analytics dashboard, without the User ID or Username.

## User Flags

We save three flags about you:
- Has Used PluralKit: whether you have used PluralKit previously or not. We use that to log new usages of PluralKit for
review by the moderators.
- Auto Publish: whether your messages sent in a news channel should be automatically published.
- Sync Nicknames: whether your nickname should be synced between Quilt guilds.

# Data Retention

Data is retained indefinitely. We do not delete any data unless you request it.

# Data Governance

Database access is limited to the minimum of QuiltMC benevolent workers required to operate the service. We do not share any data with third parties.
We do not sell any data. Your data isn't shared with any contracted sub-processors.

Data is stored in a country part of the European Economic Area (EEA). Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
