## Data Collected

This data is collected to preserve historical records and conduct moderation. The data is persisted across leaving the guild and is essential to the operation of the service.

The web interface uses cookies to keep you logged in while you use it, which is essential to its functionality. Cookies are stored in your browser and can be deleted at any time.

## Data Retention

Data is retained indefinitely. We do not delete any data unless you request it.

## Data Governance

If you use the web interface, data about your connection will be processed in accordance with Cloudflare's [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) in order to faciliate your connection and operate their service.
