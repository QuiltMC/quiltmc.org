This document details what and why data is collected by The Quilt Project through the our Modmail bot, how it is used and how to use your rights related to your data.

The Quilt Project ("Us", "We", "Our") is the data controller for the data collected through our Modmail Discord bot.

We also collect the following information about the sender:

We collect that data to preserve historical data and conduct moderation. The data is persisted across leaving the guild and is essential to the operation of the service.

### Web Interface

The web interface doesn't store any personal data.

## Data Retention

Data is retained indefinitely. We do not delete any data unless you request it.
