Quilt is formed of several teams, each responsible for a small part of the work we do. The Community Team works with our community of users, and each Development Team works on a subset of the software that we develop.

## Admin Board

The Admin Board is responsible for steering and coordinating Quilt's development, and managing platforms used by multiple teams, such as GitHub. It must always have an odd number of members to prevent a voting deadlock.

## Community Team

The Community Team is in charge of managing [the Quilt Community](https://discord.quiltmc.org), as well as Quilt's blog and social media accounts.

### Community Managers

Community Managers administer the Quilt Community, support and manage the rest of the community team, and develop our [community policies](https://quiltmc.org/en/community/).
