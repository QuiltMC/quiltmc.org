    The Quilt Initiative Discord server is created, as a temporary place to put together an initial plan for the Quilt project.

    The Quilt Community Discord server is founded, to provide an official, public community space. While things are still being set up and planned out, single-use invites are handed out to trusted, prominent Fabric community members -- the server isn't made public immediately.

    To drum up some interest and figure out what the modding community would think about Quilt, one of the founding members posts a [Pastebin "leak"](https://pastebin.com/spNgyCMD) on a drama server. The document includes some information about the governance and moderation policy of a new project named "Fabrique", a false name used to avoid exposing Quilt's projects before they were ready to be made public.

    The Quilt GitHub organisation runs out of free Actions minutes, which means that its repositories must be made public. It doesn't take long for people to find them, either!

    The Quilt Community Discord server is officially made public, with proper invites being created and handed out. Almost 350 users join the server on this first day, which is emblematic of people's interest in the project and its community.

    On the same day, the Quilt Toolchain Discord server is set up and opened to the public. This server was designed for project-relevant development discussions, as a place for people to work together on Quilt and its projects, and for everyone else to gain a window into Quilt's development processes.

    On the Community server, a game of [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io) was played to celebrate the server's opening to the public. During this game, a player was tasked with drawing a pumpkin, and many of the players guessed "pineapple". This drawing quickly became a community favourite, and Pineapple was born -- Quilt's first community mascot.

    Quilt officially entered its first beta today, attracting an influx of new users and an amazing amount of support and positive feedback. By the end of the day, Quilt was happily loading both Quilt and Fabric mods, and had [uploaded QSL to Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)

    Quilt officially sunsets the <a href={site.discordToolchain}>Toolchain Discord server</a>, merging its channels into the <a href={site.discordCommunity}>main Discord server</a>, previously the community server - in an attempt to bring the developers closer to the users.

		This server was made read-only three days later, but may still be accessed - just in case anyone needs to refer to something that was discussed there.
