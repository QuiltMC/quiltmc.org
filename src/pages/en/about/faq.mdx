## General Questions

<Message>

### What is Quilt?

Quilt is a modding toolchain developed primarily for Minecraft. We make [Quilt Loader](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-loader), a powerful mod loader which is compatible with Fabric mods; [Quilt Config](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-config), a loader-agnostic config library; [Enigma](https://github.com/QuiltMC/Enigma), a tool for de-obfuscating and remapping Java bytecode; and more! For more information, see the [About page](/en/about).

### What Happened to Quilt Standard Libraries?
[Quilt Standard Libraries](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-standard-libraries) was an alternative to Fabric API that was released when Quilt first launched. It brought several new tools for developers, but we found that keeping up with new releases of Minecraft while maintaining compatibility with Fabric API wasn't feasible, so it was discontinued in December 2025. It is still available for older versions of Minecraft from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qsl).

## User Questions

<Message>

### Why should I use Quilt?

For users, Quilt provides the following advantages:

- Better and more readable crash reports, with warnings if you accidentally load a mod that is built for an incompatible loader.
- The ability to [load mods from sub-folders of your `mods` folder](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-loader/wiki/Mod-Loading-Behaviour), with the option to only load certain folders in specific versions.
- Lots of [configuration options](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-loader/wiki/Configuration-options) and [Java/JVM Arguments](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-loader/wiki/System-Properties)
- Seamless compatibility with almost all Fabric mods.

### Can Quilt load Forge/Neoforge mods?

No, Quilt can't load Forge or Neoforge mods and support is not planned. Quilt Loader has a plugin system that would allow someone to add this in theory, but it wouldn't be officially supported.

<Message>

### Can Quilt load Fabric mods?

In most cases, yes! We have [a list](/en/usage/incompatible-mods) of all Fabric mods that aren't compatible with Quilt, and it's a pretty small number.

<Message>

### Can Fabric load Quilt mods?

No. A mod may be compatible with both Fabric and Quilt, but a mod which is made for Quilt won't work on Fabric.

### When will Quilt be released?

Quilt Loader has been in beta since April 2022. If you'd like to try it out, visit [the install page](/en/install).

## Developer Questions

<Message>

### Why should I choose Quilt Loader for my mods?

Here are some features that Quilt Loader offers developers:

- [A `@Requires` annotation](https://quiltmc.org/en/changelog/quilt-loader/0.25.0/) to remove a given element if the specified mod is not present, similar to `@ClientOnly` or `@DedicatedServerOnly`.
- Built-in support for [Quilt Config](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-config), our loader-agnostic config library.
- APIs to display errors in the loader's GUI and add buttons to fix them.
- An API to partition off your mod's internals and prevent them from being accessed by other mods.

### Where's the developer documentation?

Quilt's developer documentation is **incredibly work-in-progress** and nowhere near a usable state. An early preview is available at [wiki.quiltmc.org](https://wiki.quiltmc.org).

### How do I get started with writing a Quilt mod?

Documentation is still in the works, but we do have a [template mod](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-template-mod) that you can use as a starting point.
