Quilt makes tools for modding Minecraft. We make [Quilt Loader](https://github.com/quiltmc/quilt-loader), a powerful mod loader that is compatible with Fabric mods; [Quilt Config](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-config), a loader-agnostic configuration library designed for simplicity; [Enigma](https://github.com/QuiltMC/enigma), a utility for de-obfuscating and remapping Java bytecode; [and more!](#our-projects) We also run [the Quilt Community](https://discord.quiltmc.org), a safe and friendly place to discuss modding, Minecraft, technology, and other things.

Quilt was started in 2021, building on top of the modding technology developed by [The Fabric Project](https://fabricmc.net). From 2021 to 2025, we developed [Quilt Standard Libraries](https://github.com/QuiltMC/QSL) and [Quilt Mappings](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-mappings). These are no longer maintained, but are still available for older versions of Minecraft.

To get started with Quilt, you can [install Quilt Loader](/install) in your launcher, use [our template](github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-template-mod) to get started developing your own mod, or [join the Quilt Community on Discord](https://discord.quiltmc.org) to talk with other Quilt users and developers, and get help using Quilt software.

## Our Projects
### Current Projects
- [**Quilt Loader**](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-loader): A Fabric-compatible mod loader with comprehensive crash reporting, more APIs for modders, and [lots of advanced configuration options](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-loader/wiki/Configuration-options)
- [**Quilt Config**](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-config): A configuration library which works in any Java program and is [included in Quilt Loader](https://wiki.quiltmc.org/en/configuration/getting-started)
- [**Enigma**](https://github.com/QuiltMC/enigma): A utility for de-obfuscating and remapping Java bytecode, with comprehensive analysis and statistics tools to help you map
- [**Quilt Loom**](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-loom): A Gradle plugin based on [Loom](https://github.com/fabricmc/fabric-loom) with support for the [`quilt.mod.json` specification](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/main/specification/0002-quilt.mod.json.md)
- [**The Quilt Community**](https://discord.quiltmc.org): A safe and friendly Discord community to discuss modding, Minecraft, technology, and more

### Past Projects
- [**Quilt Standard Libraries**](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-standard-libraries): An alternative to Fabric API. It was discontinued when keeping up-to-date with the changes in both Minecraft and Fabric API became infeasible, but is still available for older versions of Minecraft on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qsl).
- [**Quilted Fabric API**](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilted-fabric-api): A compatibility layer which allowed mods written with Fabric API to work with Quilt Standard Libraries. It was discontinued with QSL, but is bundled with it on Modrinth and CurseForge.
- [**Quilt Mappings**](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-mappings): A set of mappings for de-obfuscating Minecraft code. It was made obsolete in 2025 when Mojang [removed obfuscation from Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition).
- [**Quilt Kotlin Libraries**](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-kotlin-libraries): A set of libraries for developing Quilt mods using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org). It was discontinued due to a lack of demand and maintainers.
- [**Chasm**](https://github.com/QuiltMC/chasm): An experimental project designed to facilitate conflict-free bytecode manipulation. While an interesting concept, it was extremely difficult to implement in practice, and many of the theoretical benefits are now available in [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras).
- [**The Quilt Forum**](https://forum.quiltmc.org): An alternative community space to Discord. It was discontinued due to a lack of activity, but the archives are still available to browse.
