This section of the site contains staff guidance documents, split up by the specific teams that they're intended for.
They act as a set of extra guidelines that staff members can use to guide their work, which helps to keep things
efficient and consistent.

These documents are made public here for the sake of transparency. Of course, we're always happy to take suggestions
and feedback too -- feel free to send us a message on Discord and we'll have a chat.
