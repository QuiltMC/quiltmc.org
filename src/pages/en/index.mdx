    # The Quilt Project

    The Quilt project is an open-source, community-driven modding toolchain
    designed primarily for Minecraft. By focusing on speed, ease of use and
    modularity, Quilt aims to provide a sleek and modern modding toolchain
    with an open ecosystem.

    Quilt is a project that was born out of a need for change in the
    Minecraft modding ecosystem. Our teams contain many experienced members
    of the modding community, providing a level of familiarity that helps us
    to avoid the mistakes of the past -- whether those mistakes relate to
    community management, diversity and inclusivity, project governance or
    transparency. For more information on how we hope to do this,
    <Link to="/about/">please see our "about" pages</Link>.
  </div>
  <div slot="wip">
    **Quilt is currently in beta.** Here be dragons - there may be issues,
    but we'll fix them as quickly as we can!

    If you'd like to help us test Quilt, please feel free to
    <Link to="/install/">install it</Link>, try it, and let us know how
    you get on!
  </div>
  <div slot="caring">
    Quilt is community-driven, and couldn't exist without its users and
    contributors. We care about our community; whether you're a member of our
    community spaces, an occasional contributor to one of our projects or
    simply a user: **Quilt exists for your needs** -- not in spite of them.
  </div>
  <div slot="modular">
    Quilt's modularity doesn't just exist to help with organising its code --
    **it extends to its users and modders too**. If you're a modder, our build
    tools will keep track of the Quilt libraries your mod uses. If you're a
    user, Quilt can automatically download the Quilt libraries needed to run
    your mods.
  </div>
  <div slot="powerful">
    Quilt has the extra features and tools your mods need to succeed. From a
    rich library of modules that help you to write more compatible mods with
    less effort, to one of the most accurate decompilers provided by any
    Minecraft modding toolchain, you can be sure that **your mod is in good
    hands**.
