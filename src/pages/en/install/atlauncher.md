ATLauncher is a simple, easy-to-use launcher, built around the concept of building game instances from "packs". To set up your own Quilt instance, simply follow these steps:

1. Download and install ATLauncher from [their website](https://atlauncher.com)
2. Open ATLauncher and click on the **Vanilla Packs** tab on the right side
3. Fill out the **Instance Name** and **Instance Description** boxes as required
4. Pick the version of Minecraft you'd like to use for your instance
5. Pick **Quilt** from the list of loaders below the Minecraft versions section
6. Select the Quilt Loader version you'd like to use
7. Click **Create Instance** to create your instance

That's all there is to it! You can find your new instance in the **Instances** tab on the right side of the window.

# Installing Mods

To install mods to your ATLauncher instance, simply follow these steps:

1. Click on the **Instances** tab on the right side
2. Find the instance you'd like to add mods to, and click on **Add Mods**
3. Find a Fabric or Quilt mod from CurseForge or Modrinth, and click the **Add** button
4. Ensure you have the **Quilt Standard Libraries** installed, which you can find [on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)

If you can't find the mod you'd like to install using the built-in search, you can click on **Open Folder** and copy any mod files you'd like to use into the `mods/` folder.

Start up your game, and the mods should be available immediately. If you run into any issues, please take a look at the [troubleshooting page](/en/usage/troubleshooting), or [join us on Discord](https://discord.quiltmc.org) to ask for support!
