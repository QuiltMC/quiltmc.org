	Please note that BakaXL is a launcher primarily designed for the Chinese market - they have done their best to localize the launcher, but if you don't speak Chinese then you may have a hard time reading some of its text.

	If you'd like to contribute to BakaXL's translations, you can do so [on GitHub](https://github.com/BakaXL-Launcher/BakaXL).

BakaXL is a launcher designed for Chinese users, with a broad focus on usability and a modern theme. In order to set up and use a Quilt "core", follow these steps:

1. Download and install BakaXL from [their website](https://www.bakaxl.com)
2. Open BakaXL and agree to install updates (using the button to the bottom-right of the dialog), if any are available
3. Follow the instructions to set up the launcher and log into your Minecraft profile
4. Click on the tile that looks like a pentagon to add a new core
5. Select "Automatically install core", and select the Minecraft version you'd like to use
6. Click on "Quilt", and select the Quilt loader version you'd like to use
7. Click on "Install Now"
8. Click on the "9" icon in the upper left corner to return home

That's all there is to it! You can find your new instance in the **cores** section, by clicking on the circular icon on the bottom-right of the main window.

# Installing Mods

To install mods to your BakaXL core, simply follow these steps:

1. Click on the circular icon on the bottom-right of the main window
2. Select the core you'd like to add mods to
3. Click on "Advanced Core Management"
4. Select "Mods", and click on the second option below "Mods Folder", which will open the `mods` folder in your file explorer
4. Download the mods you'd like to install, and copy or move them into the folder that just opened
5. Ensure you have also added the **Quilted Fabric API/Quilt Standard Libraries** bundle, which you can find [on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qsl) or [on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)

Start up your game, and the mods should be available immediately. If you run into any issues, please take a look at the [troubleshooting page](/en/usage/troubleshooting), or [join us on Discord](https://discord.quiltmc.org) to ask for support!
