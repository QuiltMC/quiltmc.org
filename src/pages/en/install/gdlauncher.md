### Status: Pending Discussion

GDLauncher does not currently support Quilt, but we've [opened a GitHub issue](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/GDLauncher/issues/1308) to ask about having Quilt support added. If you're interested in seeing Quilt support in GDLauncher, feel free to take a look at that issue.

# Manual Installation

At the moment, we don't know whether it's possible to manually install Quilt using GDLauncher. If you have any information on this, please let us know!
