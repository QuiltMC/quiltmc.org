This page contains a list of all past and present sponsorships that Quilt holds, what they provide us, and instructions for applying to become a Quilt sponsor.

Though Quilt is not and will hopefully never be a financially-driven project, sponsors can help us offset our costs, or provide tools or services that would otherwise be inaccessible to us. To help minimize the risk of issues that can occur when introducing sponsorships into an open-source project like Quilt, we have a detailed processes for dealing with sponsorships, detailed in [the Sponsorships RFC](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0061-sponsorships.md).

There are two main types of sponsors, endorsed and non-endorsed. Endorsed sponsors are those that require an endorsement from us, such as their logo on our site homepage. Non-endorsed sponsors do not require an endorsement.

## Current Sponsors

### 1Password (Non-Endorsed)
1Password is a company that makes password managers and other tools for securely storing credentials. They provide us with a free 1Password Teams account to share infrastructure keys, social media logins, and other sensitive data, as part of their [1Password for Open Source Projects](https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source) program.

### AWS (Non-Endorsed)
AWS is a cloud provider. Much of our infrastructure, including our Meta, Maven, and email system is hosted through AWS, and they provide us with credits to offset that cost through their [Promotional Credits for Open Source Projects](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-promotional-credits-open-source-projects/) program.

### Starchild Systems (Endorsed)
Starchild Systems is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service company. They host the <a href={site.forum}>Quilt Forum</a> on their infrastructure at no cost to us.

## Sponsoring Quilt
If you want to sponsor Quilt, here's a summary of how to do it. For detailed information on our processes for accepting and handling sponsors, please see the [Sponsorships RFC](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0061-sponsorships.md).

If you're just an individual person wanting to support us and help cover our costs, the best way to do that is by donating on our [OpenCollective Page](https://opencollective.com/quiltmc).

In addition to Endorsed and Non-Endorsed sponsors, there are two types of sponsorship: Financial and Non-Financial. Financial Sponsorships are those that provide direct financial contributions to Quilt through our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/quiltmc), and non-financial sponsorships are those that provide tools or services to us at a discounted price. When offering us a sponsorship, please include whether it is a financial or non-financial sponsorship, as well as if you would like to be endorsed or not.

When deciding whether to accept a sponsorship, we look for sponsors that provide high-quality products at fair and competitive prices, market their products transparently and honestly, and do not discriminate against minorities, have a history of anti-consumer practices, or conduct business in a way that is unsustainable or especially harmful to the environment. For the full list of Sponsorship Guidelines, see the [Sponsorships RFC](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0061-sponsorships.md).

A good sponsorship offer should include the following:
- Information about you, the sponsor.
- What the sponsorship is (tools, services or money).
- Any additional terms of the sponsorship (if applicable).
- Links to your website, social media etc. We're more likely to accept your sponsorship if you have a website with lots of details about your offerings.
  
To offer us a sponsorship, please email the Outreach Team at `outreach at quiltmc.org`. We look forward to hearing from you!
