This page contains a list of all of Quilt's past and present sponsorships, what they provide/provided us through those sponsorships, and instructions for applying to become a Quilt sponsor.

While Quilt is not (and hopefully never will be) a financially-driven project, sponsors help us to offset our costs, or provide tools or services that would otherwise be inaccessible to us. Additionally, in order to maintain transparency and to try to avoid problems (such as accepting a sponsorship and endorsing a problematic company), we have a [detailed process](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0061-sponsorships.md) that we follow when evaluating and accepting sponsorships.

Sponsorships may be endorsed, or non-endorsed. If a sponsorship is endorsed, then we've vetted the company to ensure they meet our [sponsorship guidelines](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/main/rfc/0061-sponsorships.md#sponsor-guidelines) and we're happy to recommend their services to our community members.

# Current Sponsors (Endorsed)

# Sponsoring Quilt

For detailed information on our processes for accepting and handling sponsors, please see the [Sponsorships RFC](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0061-sponsorships.md).

If you're an individual that just wishes to support us and help cover our costs, the best way to do so is by donating directly on our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/quiltmc).

In addition to Endorsed and Non-Endorsed sponsors, there are two types of sponsorship: Financial and Non-Financial. Financial Sponsorships are those that provide direct financial contributions to Quilt through our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/quiltmc), and non-financial sponsorships are those that provide tools or services to us at a discount, or for free. When offering us a sponsorship, please include whether it is a financial or non-financial sponsorship, as well as if you would like to be endorsed or not.

When deciding whether to accept a sponsorship, we look for sponsors that provide high-quality products at fair and competitive prices, market their products transparently and honestly, and do not discriminate against minorities, have a history of anti-consumer practices, or conduct business in a way that is unsustainable or especially harmful to the environment. For the full list of Sponsorship Guidelines, see the [Sponsorships RFC](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0061-sponsorships.md).

A good sponsorship offer should include the following:

* Information about you, the sponsor
* What the sponsorship is (tools, services or money)
* Any additional terms of the sponsorship (if applicable)
* Links to your website, social media etc -- we're more likely to accept your sponsorship if you have a website with lots of details about your offerings

To offer us a sponsorship, please email the Outreach Team at <a href="maito:outreach@quiltmc.org">outreach@quiltmc.org</a>. We look forward to hearing from you!
