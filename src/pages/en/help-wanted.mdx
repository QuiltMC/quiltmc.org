The Quilt Project is extremely community-oriented, and that means that it needs your help to succeed. This page is a
list of opportunities to contribute - from contributing code to joining the Community team.

## Development

Development teams serve as the primary maintainers of the tools that make up Quilt, from build tools to mappings, libraries, and loaders.
Development teams are responsible for triage, merging PRs, and helping the community maintain their respective projects.

While teams provide a democratic leadership of each project, you **do not have to be on a team to contribute.** Team members come from experienced contributors who are interested in taking additional responsibility.

If you want to help out with development, some projects that could use help are listed below.

### Chasm

The Chasm team is responsible for building and maintaining the [Chasm project](https://github.com/QuiltMC/chasm). Chasm
is a bytecode transformer project, designed to handle collisions between transformers in as compatible a way as
possible.

This is a fairly technical project, but it's also one of our most interesting ones! If you're interested in helping out
with the Chasm project, please sent a message in `#chasm` on the
[Discord Server](https://discord.quiltmc.org/).

### Mappings Triage

The Mappings team is responsible for Quilt Mappings and its backbone projects, such as Hashed Mojmap. This team is
always looking for more reviewers, who inspect Pull Requests to Quilt Mappings and ensure that they're high quality and meet the project's requirements.

Experienced reviewers can join the Mappings Triage team, which give the final approval on Quilt Mappings PRs.

If you'd like to learn more, please send a message in `#mappings` on
the [Discord Server](https://discord.quiltmc.org/).

### QSL

QSL is always looking for PR authors and reviewers, who help QSL expand in scope to be a high quality and fully featured modding API. Reviewers inspect API structure, javadoc, implementation, etc for clarity and quality, ensuring QSL is both easy to use and easy to maintain. Experienced reviewers can join the QSL Triage team, which is responsible for giving the final approval on QSL PRs.

If you'd like to write a QSL module or start reviewing PRs, please send a message in `#quilt-standard-libraries` on
the [Discord Server](https://discord.quiltmc.org/)

### Quilted Fabric API

Quilted Fabric API is a re-implementation of Fabric API using QSL. We are looking for help maintaining this project!
As a maintainer, you would share the responsibility for merging changes from upstream Fabric API, ensuring that it doesn't conflict with QSL,
and re-implementing Fabric API features in QSL once they become available.

If you're interested in taking up this role, please send a message in `#quilt-standard-libraries` on the
[Discord Server](https://discord.quiltmc.org/)

## Community Team

The Community Team is responsible for taking care of our community, helping it grow, and keeping it safe, welcoming and
running smoothly. Joining it is a great way to contribute if you're not a developer, or just not interested in
developing modding technologies.

### Moderators

Moderators are the backbone of our community, ensuring that everyone is safe, that rules are enforced, and that
discussions are conducted in a productive manner. While the current team can handle the amount of activity that our
communities receive, the team needs to be expanded to deal with the increasing interest and community activity over
time, and as development progresses.

If you'd like to apply to be a Moderator, please join the [Community Discord Server](https://discord.quiltmc.org) and
DM ModMail to send in your application. It is recommended that you read our
[Rules](https://quiltmc.org/community/rules) and [Code of Conduct](https://quiltmc.org/community/code-of-conduct)
before applying.
