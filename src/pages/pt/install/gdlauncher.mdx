### Status: Work In Progress

GDLauncher does not currently support Quilt, but a member of the community has [submitted a Pull Request](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/GDLauncher/pull/1400) that adds Quilt support. If you're interested in seeing Quilt support in GDLauncher, feel free to take a look at that PR.

# Workarounds

<Message style={"danger"}>
	Please note that the following solutions are maintained by third party developers. We cannot guarantee their efficacy over time -- and, while we believe them to be entirely safe, we can't take responsibility for any issues caused by them.

	**Please remember to back up your worlds if you attempt to use the following solutions on an existing launcher profile!**

If you can't wait for GDLauncher to support Quilt, then [kb1000](https://www.curseforge.com/members/kb1000) maintains one possible solution:

1. Create a Forge profile
2. Add [JumpQuilt](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jumpquilt), which will hijack the Forge loading process to load Quilt instead
3. Add your mods as usual
4. Ensure you have also added the **Quilted Fabric API/Quilt Standard Libraries** bundle, which you can find [on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qsl)

We're aware that this isn't an ideal solution for a number of reasons. Please show your support on the Pull Request linked above if you'd like to see a better solution!
