### Status: Planned

CurseForge does not currently support Quilt, but they've stated they're planning on it. 

Thanks to Claycorp, RedBlue and Yamza for their help, as well as to everyone that supported our
[CurseForge Ideas suggestion](https://curseforge-ideas.overwolf.com/ideas/CF-I-2662). We couldn't have gotten this far 
without you!

# Manual Installation

It is not currently possible to manually install Quilt into a CurseForge instance. Please show your support on the
suggestion linked above if you'd like to see CurseForge adding Quilt to their services!
