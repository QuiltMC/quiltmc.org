ATLauncher is a simple, easy-to-use launcher, built around the concept of building game instances from "packs". To set 
up your own Quilt instance, simply follow these steps:

1. Download and install ATLauncher from [their website](https://atlauncher.com)
2. Open ATLauncher and click on the **Vanilla Packs** tab on the right side
3. Fill out the **Instance Name** and **Instance Description** boxes as required
4. Pick the version of Minecraft you'd like to use for your instance
5. Pick **Quilt** from the list of loaders below the Minecraft versions section
6. Select the Quilt Loader version you'd like to use
7. Click **Create Instance** to create your instance

That's all there is to it! You can find your new instance in the **Instances** tab on the right side of the window.
