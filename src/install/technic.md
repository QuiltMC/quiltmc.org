### Status: Suggested

The Technic Launcher does not currently support Quilt. If you'd like to see Technic add Quilt support to their 
launcher, please feel free to join [their Discord server](https://discord.gg/technic), leave a positive reaction on our 
post in their `#suggestions` channel, and mention that you'd like to see support in `#suggestions-discussion`.

# Manual Installation

At the moment, we don't know whether it's possible to manually install Quilt using the Technic Launcher. If you have 
any information on this, please let us know!
