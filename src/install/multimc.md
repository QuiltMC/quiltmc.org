MultiMC is a launcher with advanced features to allow power users to manage separate instances of Minecraft.
To set up a Quilt instance with MultiMC, follow these steps:

1. Download and install MultiMC from [their website](https://multimc.org). If you're on Windows, extract the
   zip file somewhere and run the MultiMC.exe executable to open it
2. Open MultiMC and follow the setup steps
3. As Quilt is currently only supported on the development version of MultiMC, you'll need to change the update
   channel. Click the **Settings** button at the top of the window, and change the **Update Channel** from 
   **Stable** to **Development**
4. Close the settings and press the **Update** button and then **Update Now** to update to the development
   build
5. Click on the **Add Instance** button at the top of the window
6. Fill out the **Name** and **Group** boxes as required
7. Make sure **Vanilla** is selected on the left and select the Minecraft version you'd like to use for
   your instance
8. Click **OK** to create a new vanilla instance
9. Right click on the new instance and select **Edit Instance**, or click the instance once and select
   **Edit Instance** from the panel on the right
10. Make sure **Version** is selected on the left, and press the **Install Quilt** button on the menu
    on the right of the window
11. Select the Quilt Loader version you'd like to use and press **OK**
12. Set up the rest of your instance as normal

That's all there is to it! Once you've followed these steps, your instance should be ready to go &mdash; just add your 
mods and get playing.

# Installing Mods

To install mods to your MultiMC instance, simply follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the instance you'd like to install mods to and select **Edit Instance**, or click on it once and
   select **Edit Instance** from the menu on the right of the window
2. Select **Mods** from the list on the left, and drag-and-drop the mod files you've downloaded into the mod list
3. Ensure you have the **Quilt Standard Libraries** installed, which you can find
   [on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)

Start up your game, and the mods should be available immediately. If you run into any issues, please take a look at the
