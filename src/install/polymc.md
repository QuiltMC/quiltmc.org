To install mods to your PolyMC instance, simply follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the instance you'd like to install mods to and select **Edit Instance**, or click on it once and select **Edit Instance** from the menu on the right of the window
2. Select **Mods** from the list on the left, and click on the **Download mods** button in the menu on the right side of the window
3. Find a mod from CurseForge or Modrinth, and click the **Select mod for download** button
4. Ensure you have selected **Quilt Standard Libraries** to be installed with the mod downloader, alternatively download [on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)

you've downloaded into the mod list, and PolyMC will ensure it's installed properly.

Start up your game, and the mods should be available immediately. If you run into any issues, please take a look at the
