# The Quilt Project

The Quilt project is an open-source, community-driven modding toolchain designed primarily for Minecraft. By focusing
on speed, ease of use and modularity, Quilt aims to provide a sleek and modern modding toolchain with an open ecosystem.

Quilt is a project that was born out of a need for change in the Minecraft modding ecosystem. Our teams contain many
experienced members of the modding community, providing a level of familiarity that helps us to avoid the mistakes of
the past -- whether those mistakes relate to community management, diversity and inclusivity, project governance or
transparency. For more information on how we hope to do this, [please see our "about" pages](/about/).

**Quilt is currently still in development.** This means that it's not ready for
use just yet, but we're working on it!

If you'd like to keep an eye on what's going on, please feel free to check out
[the launch roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/QuiltMC/projects/1), or join us on
Discord using the links you'll find further down this page.

    <span>Caring</span>
  </span>
</h2>

Quilt is community-driven, and couldn't exist without its users and contributors. We care about our community; whether
you're a member of our community spaces, an occasional contributor to one of our projects or simply a user: **Quilt
exists for your needs** -- not in spite of them.

    <span>Modular</span>
  </span>
</h2>

Quilt's modularity doesn't just exist to help with organising its code -- **it extends to its users and modders too**.
If you're a modder, our build tools will keep track of the Quilt libraries your mod uses. If you're a user, Quilt can
automatically download the Quilt libraries needed to run your mods.

    <span>Powerful</span>
  </span>
</h2>

Quilt has the extra features and tools your mods need to succeed. From a rich library of modules that help you to write
more compatible mods with less effort, to one of the most accurate decompilers provided by any Minecraft modding
toolchain, you can be sure that **your mod is in good hands**.
