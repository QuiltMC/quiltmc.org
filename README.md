# Quilt Project Website

Website for the Quilt Project.

## Building

This is a static site built with [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro). First install `pnpm` and then follow the steps below.

1. Install dependencies by running `pnpm i`.
2. Build the site with `pnpm build`.

## Contributing

To make changes to the site, you will do the same basic thing as above, but with some slight changes to make development easier. You still only need `pnpm`.

1. Install dependencies by running `pnpm install`.
2. Start Astro with `pnpm dev`. This will automatically
   rebuild the site and make your browser reload the page any time you make
   changes.
3. See the website and your changes at `localhost:3000`.
