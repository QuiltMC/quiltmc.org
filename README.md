# Quilt Project Website

Website for the Quilt Project.

## Building

This is a static site built with Jekyll and webpack. First install `pnpm` and then follow the steps below.

1. Install dependencies by running `pnpm install`.
2. Build the site with `pnpm build`.

## Contributing

To make changes to the site, you will do the same basic thing as above, butbwith some slight changes to make development easier. You still only need `pnpm`.

1. Install dependencies by running `pnpm install`.
2. Start Astro with `pnpm start`. This will automatically rebuild the site and make your browser reload the page any time you make changes.
3. See the website and your changes at `localhost:3000`.
